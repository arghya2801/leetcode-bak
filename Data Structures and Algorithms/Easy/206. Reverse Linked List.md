I had two approaches to this question. First was the stack method, where I added all the elements in a stack, then created a new linked list by popping the elements of the stack. This was a simple and straight forward method.

The other approach was directly using the linked list itself. Concept was to reverse the pointers.

Here I create a node `next` which is equal to `current->next`. The I changed `current->next` to be the previous node, which I initialized to NULL. Then I changed the `prev` node as current and the current one as next. This kept looping till we reach the end of the list, thus changing the direction of all the pointers.
