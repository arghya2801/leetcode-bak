This was an easy question, but a good one to practice queues. 

First we add the root to the queue. This will be level one. Then we create a vector called 'level'. This will basically create the arrays of each level as asked in the question. To make sure this doesn't print the entire queue directly, we iterate from 0 to the size of the queue. This way, we by the time we are done with a given level, the elements of the queue will have been popped out, hence giving us an array with only elements of that particular level.
