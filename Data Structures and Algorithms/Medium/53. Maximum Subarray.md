```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_sub = nums[0];
        int current_sum = 0;

        int size = nums.size();

        for (int n = 0; n < size; n++){
            if (current_sum < 0) {
                current_sum = 0;
            }
            current_sum += nums[n];
            max_sub = max(max_sub, current_sum);
        }

        return max_sub;
    }
};

Basically, start with the 0th element. Then iterate while adding. If the sum is less than zero, it will reset to zero, otherwise add the next on the next iteration. the `max_sub` is the bigger value between the current element and the current sum. This way we iterate through the entire array (like a window closing) and figure out the biggest array.

Since we only need the sum, we just return the max_sub variable, and that makes the question easier than if it was to return the array.
